# Staggered Grid w/ Matched Geometry Effect

This app displays artwork of varying aspect ratios in a lazy vertically scrolling view, simulating user's posts. 

The plus and minus buttons will increase or decrease the number of columns (1 ~ 5), displaying the images in a staggered grid.

### Matched Geometry Animation Effect
Using the @Namespace property wrapper allows use of the Matched Geometry Effect, where the images are smoothly moved to their new location.
