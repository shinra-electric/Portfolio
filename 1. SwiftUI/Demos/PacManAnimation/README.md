#  PacMan 

This demo draws and animates PacMan across the screen. 

PacMan is defined using a Shape struct with the details of the mouth movement and eye location, and then animated using the withAnimation modifier in ContentView.

This demo was by [CodeSlicing](https://youtu.be/mprzVGTJwM0) and was originally supposed to demonstrate his PureSwiftUI package that hugely simplifies drawing and animation. However I used standard SwiftUI here so I did not need to add additional packages to github. 
Using the PureSwiftUI package, the body and eye shapes and animations are extremely concise and clear to code.
