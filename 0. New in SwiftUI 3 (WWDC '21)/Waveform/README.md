# Canvas Waveform

This app uses the new TimelineView and Canvas features in SwiftUI 3 to animate two waves.

### TimelineView

SwiftUI now has a timeline view that will redraw its content at set intervals. It's very useful for animations.  

### Canvas

Canvas is a modern, GPU-accelerated API for low-level drawing primitives. It is the equivalent of drawRect used in Core Graphics and UIKit. 

### Bonus

I used SwiftUI 2's Colorpicker to add the option to customise the waves' colours, as well as adjusting the wave height and direction.
