This is a simple app that splits a restaurant bill, and optionally includes a tip.  

It is the first tutorial in the series, so just explains: 

* Forms
* Navigation bars
* @State property wrappers
* Two-way binding
* Using ForEach loops with Views
* Using different keyboards
* Pickers and segmented controls
