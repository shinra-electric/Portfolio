# iExpense App
Example app for SwiftUI

This is a simple app that allows you to add expenses to a list, entering the amount and indicating whether they are business or personal expenses. 

It also introduces: 

* @ObservedObject property wrappers
* Presenting and dismissing additional views as sheets
* Deleting rows from a list
* Saving and loading user data with UserDefaults and Codable (with JSON)
* The Identifiable protocol
