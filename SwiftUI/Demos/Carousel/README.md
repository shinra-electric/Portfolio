# Animated Carousel

This app just displays several film posters, using animation and scale effects to push them into the background when swiping up. 

It demonstrates several new features in SwiftUI 3, and is from a demo by [Kavsoft](https://youtu.be/Wj_PJBWHWUc)

* Note: When creating this there was a bug in Xcode 13 Beta 2 that affected SwiftUI TabViews, so this demo creates a custom TabView in UIKit.  It normally should not be necessary.
