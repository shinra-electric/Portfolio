#  New Buttons in SwiftUI 3 

SwiftUI got another significant update in WWDC '21, and these apps are to demonstrate some of the new features. 

* The new .bordered button style is similar to the ones that Apple has been using in its apps
* Important buttons can now be emphasised with .controlProminence(.increased)
* Buttons can now be given a .controlSize() modifier of .small, .regular or .large
* Buttons can be given a .tint() with several new standard colours that work with both light and dark modes.
* Toggles now have a new .button toggle style
