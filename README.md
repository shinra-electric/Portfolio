# A Bit About Me

I am a recent Computer Science graduate, having obtained a Postgraduate Diploma with first-class honours from Griffith College Dublin in 2019.

This was my third time in university, and I have previously had a successful career in International Private Medical Insurance. I have also been based in China, Japan, Singapore and Hong Kong for the last 15 years. I speak Mandarin well, and I'm fairly competent in Japanese.

After a lengthy career in IPMI, I had decided to go back to university in order to pursue a new career doing something I was actually excited about.

Even though the CS course I did was very useful, it did not touch app development at all, and I only created small apps using Java and JavaFX. Therefore since graduation I have been learning Swift and decided to start learning SwiftUI. 

### What's the point of this repository? 

Getting a first job as a developer is extremely challenging, as every company (that I've seen) requires new hires to have a minimum of 2~3 years experience. Even fresh graduates are expected to have some form of work experience.

(The coronavirus pandemic has also not helped the situation much, with a lot of companies putting freezes on new hires).

So this repository is kind of a practice portfolio where I will be posting example code and the end result of various tutorials that I've been following. 

The hope is that I can share this link and it will demonstrate my understanding of programming and will eventually lead to employment. 

### What languages/technologies am I familiar with? 

In university, I was introduced to: 

* Java and JavaFX
* HTML5 / CSS 3 / PHP (w/ Bootstrap)
* MySQL

Since graduating I have been studying: 

* Swift 
* SwiftUI
* RealityKit (AR)
* SpriteKit
* Vapor (Server-side Swift)
* Python (for some job interviews)

### What do I love working on?

Since I'm a Mac and iPhone user and the iOS market is very large, I decided to self-study Swift and SwiftUI, and try to get a position as an iOS developer. I knew that it would probably take time before I could get a job, because large codebases for existing iOS apps would be using AppKit and possibly even Objective-C. This would mean I wouldn't be able to bring much value to these projects right out of the gate.

I found that I quite enjoy designing the UI for iOS apps, and find SwiftUI to be very simple yet powerful.

SwiftUI is also still not a finished product, and even with the release of SwiftUI 2 in iOS 14 that brings it much further along, it is still a step behind the much-more mature AppKit. However, SwiftUI is the future and unifies app development across all of Apple's platforms. While it may not help me much right now, at some point in the future all new projects targeting Apple's platforms will be using SwiftUI.

But if I can demonstrate an understanding of Swift and SwiftUI it shows I'm at least capable of learning AppKit (maybe even Obj-C!). Not to mention that using Xcode and the process of posting to the AppStore are the same regardless what language or APIs are used.

### What tutorials have I been following? 

I started with Paul Hudson's <a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com">Hacking With Swift</a> course, which is an excellent free online course, and I recommend to everyone who is interested in coding. 

While researching solutions to various problems I encountered, I also came across <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/azamsharp/">Azam Sharp's YouTube Channel</a>, which I found quite useful. 

I also followed some of the free tutorials on <a href="https://www.raywenderlich.com/paths#ios">Ray Wenderlich's site</a>.

I've also learned from random places on the internet or YouTube, and I will try to give proper attribution. If I miss any, please let me know and I'll update accordingly. 

### Note: 

SwiftUI 2 and XCode 12 were released recently, completely doing away with delegates. I am in the process of updating or re-implementing all the tutorials I have done in Xcode 12 along with a clear description of what was covered, and I will post them to GitHub when done. I'm not backporting any SwiftUI 2 features yet, though that is something I might do once everything is posted.
