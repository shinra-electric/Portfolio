# SwiftUI
Even though I have a higher diploma in Computer Science, I did not touch app development at all during that course, creating only small apps using Java and JavaFX. Therefore since graduation I have been learning Swift and decided to start learning SwiftUI. 

Getting a first job as an iOS developer is extremely challenging, as every company (that I've seen) requires new hires to have a minimum of 2~3 years experience. Even fresh graduates are expected to have work experience. 

So this repository is kind of a practice portfolio where I am posting SwiftUI example code and the end result of various tutorials that I've been following. 
The hope is that I can share this link and it will demonstrate my understanding of Swift and SwiftUI and hopefully lead to employment.  

When I made the decision to learn Swift and SwiftUI I knew that it would probably take time before I could get a job, because large codebases for existing iOS apps would be using AppKit and possibly even Objective-C. This would mean I would be a mostly useless addition to these projects. SwiftUI is also still not a finished product, and even with the release of SwiftUI 2 in iOS 14 that brings it much further it is still a step behind the much more mature AppKit. However, SwiftUI is the future and unifies app development across all of Apple's platforms. While it may not help much right now, at some point all new projects will be using SwiftUI.

And there is also the point that if I have experience in Swift and SwiftUI it shows at least I'm capable of learning how to use AppKit and maybe even Obj-C.
