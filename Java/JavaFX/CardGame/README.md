# Hi-Low Card Game
JavaFX University Assignment 

This is a simple higher-lower guessing style card game. 

For the assignment we were given screenshots of what the layout should look like, and were tasked to make a working copy with an identical layout. However we could customise the appearance. 

* Built using JavaFX in Eclipse
* Added custom sounds 
* Added custom card back 
* Added custom dark appearance using CSS
* Added gif animation on win and custom about dialog

*Note: This app was created in an older version of Eclipse, and I was not able to get JavaFX running in Eclipse 2020-12. I intend to refactor to get it running in IntelliJ. 

The card face images were provided by our instructor. I sourced the Cthulu-themed card back from <a href="http://clipart-library.com/clip-art/149-1497738_playing-card-back-design-fractal-art.htm">Clipart Library</a> (Personal use license).

I also sourced a shuffle sound from <a href="https://www.soundjay.com/card-sounds-1.html">Sound Jay</a> 

The classic Gene Wilder image and Dancing BMO gif were just sourced from Google image search.
