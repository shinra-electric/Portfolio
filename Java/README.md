# Java
 
Even though I have been recently studying Swift, I learned programming in university using Java. 

I used to use Eclipse, but I've been having trouble getting the updated version to run JavaFX, so I changed to IntelliJ CE. 

I find it to be cleaner and more integrated then Eclipse, but neither of them are what you could call user-friendly.... 

Everything posted is either straight from my old Eclipse workspace (and may not work on new versions), or else has been re-implemented in IntelliJ. 

I was still learning best-practices when writing these, so they are rife with poorly-named variables and other issues. But they were not intended to be part of a larger project, so I think it's ok. Illustrative purposes only...
