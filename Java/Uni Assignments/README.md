# University Assignments
 
 I realised that I've been posting mostly UI projects, and I have not demonstrated use of algorithms or data structures.
 
I'm posting some of the assignments I was given in university here to not only to demonstrate that I can code in Java, but also I have experience with data structures. 

I've posted the following so far: 

* Binary Search
* Linear Search
* Self-Organising Search 

* Bubble Sort
* Insertion Sort
* Quicksort
* Selection Sort

* (...more to come).

(I may also re-implement some of these in Swift...).
