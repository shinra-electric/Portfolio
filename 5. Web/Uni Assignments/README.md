# Web Development

I completed a web development course as part of my postgrad CS course. 

Some of the topics or tools used included: 

* HTML 5
* CSS 3
* PHP 
* MySQL
* Bootstrap
* Responsive design
* Creating design documentation
* MAMP
* phpMyAdmin
* PHPStorm
* Github
* Slack

For the first two assignments the instructor provided a static image of a sample webpage, and we were tasked to re-create the site visually using bootstrap, and to add certain specified functionality. 

The third assignment was a group project where I was paired with another student, and were to create a brand-new functional website. As an aquaintance of mine had recently started a new company, we worked together to create the company website. As of writing this, the site is not yet live. Since I need permission to post this to github, I'm holding off for now. I will probably end up posting a redacted version.
