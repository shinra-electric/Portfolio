# Cupcake Corner App
Example app for SwiftUI

This is a simple tutorial app where you can: 

*Select a cupcake type from a picker
*Select a number of cupcakes using a stepper
*Add extras
*Place an order

The tutorial shows how to: 

*Make @Published property wrappers conform to the Codable protocol with a CodingKey enum
*Sending and receiving Codable data with URLSession and JSONDecoder 
*Validating and disabling Forms

From a tutorial on <a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com">HackingWithSwift</a>.

Note: This was based on the first release of SwiftUI and may be slightly outdated by the release of SwiftUI 2 with iOS 14.
