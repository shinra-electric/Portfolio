# BetterRest App
Example app for SwiftUI & CoreML

This is a simple app that calculates an optimal bedtime based on the time you want to wake up, how many hours you want to sleep, and how many coffees you've drunk over the day. 

It uses a CoreML model that was created using data from the tutorial on <a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com">HackingWithSwift</a>.
